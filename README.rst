Colons can be used to align columns in pipe tables::

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |    centered   |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |    are neat   |    $1 |

Make sure previous paragraph does not end with ``::``.

    Additional non-sub-list paragraphs require the same indentation;
    example blocks (after double colon ``::``) must be indented at
    least eight spaces more than the symbol or number, like this::
